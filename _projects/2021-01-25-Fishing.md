Fishing with The Homies, a first-person story-based fishing game inspired by games like Sega Bass Fishing, Okami, and Shigesato Itoi's No. 1 Bass Fishing.

<br> <br> The mafia are trying to take over the fishing industry, and killing everyone who stands in their way! Can you and your... zombies? ...homunculi? ...homies? stand a chance against them, until you can face off with the CodFather?

<br>I did the project direction, original design pitch, and assistance with environment design and coding.
