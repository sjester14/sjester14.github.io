The first professional project I worked on outside of a school project, as an employee of GIB Games! A VR game where you investigate a murder in a hotel in outer space.

<br>As Junior Level Designer, I helped with creating various areas of the hotel, populating them with assets and coding puzzles and dialogue to make the areas tie into the plot in more in-depth ways.
