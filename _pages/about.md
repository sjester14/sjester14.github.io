Hi, my name is Steve Jester. I graduated from Miami University in 2022 with a Bachelors of Science from Emerging Technologies in Business + Design.
<br>
Currently, I'm employed with GIB Games in Cincinnati, Ohio, as a Junior Level Designer. I've worked on Cold Start: The Callisto, Vampire: The Masquerade- Dark Skylines, and SCP: Infohazard. My main focus lies in creating environments focused around puzzles, as well as interior level designs. My current game design focus is on Virtual Reality, though we have been making our titles playable on desktop, as well.

As a student, I did a lot of smaller projects, both inside and outside of class.
One of my largest was my involvement in the [Grasshopper Manufacture Zine Vol. 2](https://ghmzine.gumroad.com/), for the story Mrs. Hachisuka's Journal, with [@Arcade_Test](https://twitter.com/arcade_test). I'm also proud of my solo zine, [A Permissible Act of Selfishness- Falling in Love With RPGs Again, Through Romancing SaGa](https://sjester.itch.io/rs-solozine), as well as [My Own Private Lospass](https://sjester.itch.io/my-own-private-lospass), a Bitsy3D+Twine project.

A lot of my influences come from Japanese game designers and creatives, as well as western indie game spaces. Currently, in my spare time, I'm working on a cel-shaded minimalist horror visual novel, influenced by the aesthetics of Revolutionary Girl Utena and The Silver Case.
